Automate the creation of streamlined, context-specific branches for your AI assistants.

## ðŸš§ Development Status

**This project is currently in active development and is not yet ready for production use.**

We are in the process of building out the core features as outlined in our [Project Roadmap](ROADMAP.md). We welcome feedback and contributions! If you're interested in helping, please see our [Contributing Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).


## The Problem

As a project grows, the entire codebase quickly becomes too large to use as a single context for an AI assistant like a Gemini Gem. To work effectively, these assistants, each assigned to a specific role, need a streamlined and relevant slice of the repository.

Manually creating and maintaining these separate, context-specific branches is a tedious and error-prone process that needs to be repeated every time the codebase changes.

## The Solution

`repo-slice` is a simple, automation-focused CLI tool designed to solve this problem. It acts as the engine of a CI/CD pipeline that automatically maintains streamlined branches for your AI assistants.

The workflow is straightforward:
1.  **Define**: List the files and directories for a specific AI role in a simple `allow-list.txt` manifest.
2.  **Slice**: In a CI/CD job, `repo-slice` reads the manifest and creates a clean, filtered copy of your repository.
3.  **Push**: The job then pushes this filtered copy to a dedicated branch (e.g., `context/gem-ui-developer`).
4.  **Configure**: Point your AI assistant at this branch, and it will always have the latest, relevant context without any manual updates.

## Core Features

* **Declarative Manifests**: Instead of complex filter patterns, you use a simple, explicit list of files in a manifest. This is easier to read, maintain, and generate programmatically.
* **Automation-Focused**: Designed from the ground up to be a reliable and portable tool for any CI/CD environment like GitHub Actions or GitLab CI.
* **Branch-Ready Output**: Produces a clean directory structure ready to be committed to a new branch, unlike tools that generate a single text file for prompting.
* **Extension Mapping**: Optionally remap file extensions during the copy process. This is useful for improving compatibility with tools that don't recognize certain extensions, such as renaming `.tsx` files to `.ts` for better LLM interpretation.


## Workflow Overview

`repo-slice` is designed to be the engine of a fully automated CI/CD pipeline. The typical workflow is as follows:

1.  **Define**: In your main branch, create and maintain a manifest file (e.g., `roles/ai-docs-writer.allow.txt`). This file declaratively lists every file and directory that is relevant to a specific AI role.
2.  **Slice**: A scheduled CI/CD job checks out your repository. It then runs the `repo-slice` command, pointing to your manifest file, which creates a clean, filtered directory.
3.  **Push**: The CI/CD job forcefully pushes the contents of this newly created directory to a dedicated context branch (e.g., `context/ai-docs-writer`), overwriting its previous contents.
4.  **Configure**: Your AI assistant (e.g., a Gemini Gem) is configured to use this specific context branch as its knowledge source, ensuring it always has the latest, most relevant information without any manual intervention.

## Quality Assurance

This project is committed to a high standard of code quality and security. To ensure this, we have integrated the following tools into our development process:

* **Coveralls**: For tracking test coverage on every pull request and ensuring it remains high.
* **SonarCloud**: For continuous static analysis to detect bugs, vulnerabilities, and code smells.
* **Snyk**: For scanning dependencies against a database of known open-source vulnerabilities.
* **Dependabot**: For automatically keeping our dependencies up-to-date.
